![Target Date](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/images_Release-Procedure/target-date.png)

To set a goal of the next release, two due dates will be announced, pull request and merged, that have 1 week interval. The due date of pull request is just a reference. It is recommended to create pull requests earlier than that date for reviewers. Note that huge pull request is difficult to review, so try to avoid creating huge one.

If the merged pull requests are enough for the next release, the release branch will be created. If some pull requests are mandatory for the release but are not merged, they will be cherry-picked after reviewed and merged.
